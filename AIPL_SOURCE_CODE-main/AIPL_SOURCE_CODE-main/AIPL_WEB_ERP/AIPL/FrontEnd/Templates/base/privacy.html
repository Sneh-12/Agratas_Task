            <p>This Privacy Policy is an electronic record, formed as per the Information Technology Act, 2000 and its associated rules, concerning electronic documents and records. It does not require any physical or digital signatures.</p>
            <p>This document serves as a legally binding agreement between you and Agratas Infotech Pvt Ltd. By accepting this Privacy Policy, either electronically (e.g., by clicking "I accept") or by using the website, you agree to the terms stated here, which will govern your relationship with Agratas Infotech Pvt Ltd for the use of the website ("Website").</p>
            <p>This policy is published in compliance with the Information Technology Act, 2000, specifically the rules regarding reasonable security practices and the handling of sensitive personal data. It governs how we collect, use, store, and transfer your information.</p>
            <p>By using the Website or providing your information, you agree to the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of both your personal and non-personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You further agree that this will not cause any loss or harm to you or others.</p>

            <h2 id="user-info">User Information</h2>
            <p>To use certain services on our website, you may need to provide personal details such as your name, email, age, gender, postal code, credit or debit card details, medical history, sexual orientation, biometric data, occupation, interests, etc. This information helps us improve our services and create a better user experience.</p>
            <p>We use this information to maintain and enhance our services, develop new ones, and potentially for advertising purposes. However, if any of this information is publicly available (e.g., via the Right to Information Act or any other law), it won’t be classified as sensitive.</p>

            <h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>
            <p>To enhance user experience, we may use "cookies" or similar technology to collect information. Cookies assign a unique User ID to each visitor and track interests based on the device used. Cookies cannot read your hard drive, and unless you provide personal details voluntarily (such as through registration), we won’t be able to identify you. Advertisers may also assign cookies to your browser, which we do not control.</p>
            <p>Additionally, our web servers may automatically collect limited data about your connection to the internet (such as your IP address) when you visit our site. This information helps deliver the requested web pages, measure site traffic, and cater to user preferences, but it does not identify you personally.</p>

            <h2 id="links">Links to Other Sites</h2>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy applies only to our website. If you follow links to external websites, we are not responsible for their privacy practices or any consequences from using those sites.</p>

            <h2 id="sharing">Information Sharing</h2>
            <p>We will not share your sensitive personal data with third parties without your consent, except in the following situations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When required by law or government authorities for identity verification, legal proceedings, or crime prevention.</li>
                <li>When sharing the information with group companies or employees for the purpose of data processing. These parties must agree to follow our Privacy Policy and maintain confidentiality.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="security">Information Security</h2>
            <p>We implement strict security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. This includes encryption, internal audits, and secure data storage. Our servers are protected by firewalls and restricted by passwords, but no system is fully secure. We cannot guarantee that information will not be intercepted during transmission over the internet, nor can we guarantee the security of information posted in public forums.</p>
            <p>As technology evolves, we may update this Privacy Policy. However, any new policy will still adhere to the principles under which your information was initially collected.</p>

            <h2 id="grievance">Grievance Redressal</h2>
            <p>If you have any complaints, concerns, or issues regarding the content, comments, or any breach of these terms, please contact the designated Grievance Officer via email or in writing.</p>
